# Caeser-Cipher

A tiny project built with Python that encrypts and decrypts text using the classic Caesar shift

FEATURES:

> Encrypt/decrypt with configurable shift (negatives allowed)
> Punctuation/whitespace passes through 

FUTURE PLANS:

> Preserve original casing (keep capitals intact after encrypt/decrypt)
